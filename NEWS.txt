** add github workflows for package and publish

## v0.4.5, 07.2020
* add functions from IAPWS R4 and R14
** R14: pressure along the melting and sublimation curves
** R4: viscosity and thermal conductivity as a function of density and temperature for heavy water substance
** test cases from documentation
** demo diagram
** add new constants

## v0.4.4, 06.2020
* fix bug in value check code in region_pT(p, T). Thanks to @sbatururimi for reporting this!

## v0.4.2, 07.2019
* fix for error in table selection for calculations for density as a function of pressure and enthalpy. Current tests did not indicate this problem - thanks to gonmolina!

## v0.4, 2018
* support for Python 3
** handling of math expressions in pyhton 3 fixed problems with some edge cases
