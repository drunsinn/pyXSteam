## v0.4.5, 07.2020
* add functions from IAPWS R4, R14, and R14
** R14: pressure along the melting and sublimation curves
** R4: viscosity and thermal conductivity as a function of density and temperature for heavy water substance
** R15: updated thermal conductivity as a function of preasure, temperature, density, viscosity, specific isobaric heat capacity an specific isochoric heat capacity
** test cases from documentation
** demo diagram
** add new constants

## v0.4.4, 06.2020
* fix bug in value check code in region_pT(p, T). Thanks to @sbatururimi for reporting this!

## v0.4.3, 04.2020
* switch to pytest for testing because of 'setup.py test' is deprecated, see https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684.

## v0.4.2, 07.2019
* fix for error in table selection for calculations for density as a function of pressure and enthalpy. Current tests did not indicate this problem - thanks to gonmolina!

## v0.4, 2018
* support for Python 3
** handling of math expressions in pyhton 3 fixed problems with some edge cases
** one test still fails: w_ps Speed of sound as a function of pressure and entropy
* fix multiple typos
* linting / cleanup of code
* add constant for absolute zero point
* command line selection for demo program
* new tests for UnitConverter

## v0.3.3b1, 21.01.2018
* fix for typo

## v0.3.3, 21.01.2018
* change changelog to markdown
* add gitignore
* remove unnecessary files
* reworked setup.py for more sanity
* cleanup and better logging

## v0.3.1, 18.02.2014
